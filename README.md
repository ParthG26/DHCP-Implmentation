# Smart Campus Simulation Using DHCP with Cisco packet Tracer

## Overview

Welcome to the Smart Campus Simulation Project repository. This repository contains the necessary files for the Smart Campus Simulation Project, which explores the potential of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in a university campus environment. The project focuses on the use of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to manage IP address allocation, network security, scalability, and resource optimization within the campus.

## Repository Contents

1. **Smart Campus (DHCP).pkt:** This Packet Tracer (pkt) file is the heart of the project. It includes the network topology, device configurations, and DHCP settings used in the Smart Campus Simulation.

2. **Smart Campus (DHCP) Report.pdf:** This PDF document provides a comprehensive report on the Smart Campus Simulation Project. It details the project's objectives, the role of DHCP, network architecture, and project outcomes. It also discusses the practical implications of IoT technology within a university campus setting.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Smart Campus Simulation Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/footcricket05/DHCP-Implementation-IoT
   ```

2. Open the `Smart Campus (DHCP).pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer to explore the network topology and DHCP configuration used in the project.

3. Review the `Smart Campus (DHCP) Report.pdf` for an in-depth understanding of the project's objectives, outcomes, and the role of DHCP within the simulation.
